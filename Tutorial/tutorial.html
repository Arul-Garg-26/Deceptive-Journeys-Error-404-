                <p>Nobody is supposed to know what your role is. Once they receive their roles, the game will start. 
                    If you are Mafia,
                    - You have to choose somebody you want to kill.
                    - if the doctor "saves" the wrong person, the person u chose to kill, dies.
                    If you are a Doctor,
                    - You have to save who you think the Mafia killed.
                    - If you select correctly, the person you tried to save, survives.
                    If you are a Detective,
                    - You have to select a player who you think is suspicious
                    - If they are the Mafia, a thumbs up will be shown. If not, a thumbs down will be shown.
                    If you are a Villager,
                    - You can vote for the person who you think is the impostor during the voting round
                    After this, a round of voting commences.
                    YOU CAN LIE OR TELL THE TRUTH. YOUR CHOICE.
                    While voting, everyone can discuss who they think the Mafia is, and finally, everyone votes for who they think the Mafia is.
                    IF YOU GET KILLED OR VOTED OUT, YOU'RE DEAD.
                    If the Mafia kills the doctor, the doctor has a chance to save himself. If he chooses himself, he survives. If not, he's dead.</p>
